Dice Game
A game created in JavaScript
--- Test your luck ---

-- > Rules:

The game starts with player 1:

The first player to reach 100 points wins.
Each player will roll the dice and try to accumulate points.
If the dice shows 1, it will switch to the next player, and the current player loses all accumulated points.
You can choose to keep the points you have accumulated with the "hold" button, but if you're greedy and try to roll the dice again to accumulate more, you can lose everything, as mentioned above.
It's a simple game, created as part of the JavaScript learning course I'm following. Good luck!!
PS: It's more fun when played with 2 players :)
